#Protect the Core

Protect the Core is a top down time based endless tower defense game created in C++ using the sfml library.

The player places turrets and barbed wire to slow and destroy an endless onslaught 
of infected cells that are attempting to destroy a core structure.
Infected cells emerge from randomly generating holes around the edge of the area so
the player must adapt their strategy accordingly to the positioning of these spawning
holes.
